###COALBOT

Run in dir 
```python coalbot.py```

##### hate it when you run out of free slack integrations? yea, me too.

earlier this year the team couldn't decide which integration to remove(I suggested giphy). So I decided to make a userbot to perform tasks!
the idea was to integrate the JIRA REST api to get tasks with more info. The Slack JIRA integration was a little s_lacking_ ha. But we ended up using the bot for general pupose fun and a few tasks that I left out for reasons. Life caught up and I wanted to bike more. So I stopped working on this.


##### Where I could have made this better
1. this could have been an actual slack integration but I think that wouldn't have solved the problem we had by using a free slack irc bot.
