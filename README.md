### COALBOTv1

Run in dir 
```python coalbot.py```

##### hate it when you run out of free slack integrations? yea, me too.

earlier this year the team couldn't decide which integration to remove(I suggested giphy). So I decided to make a userbot to perform tasks!
the idea was to integrate the JIRA REST api to get tasks with more info. The Slack JIRA integration was a little s_lacking_ ha. But we ended up using the bot for general pupose fun and a few tasks that I left out for reasons. Life caught up and I wanted to bike more. So I stopped working on this. 
 
### Things todo
1. Investigate how to port into a slack integration (possibly)
2. Turn this into a flask app that is more modular
4. Model out data to handle multiple bots and mulitple tasks
5. Bot maker and task maker.
6. run task service.
